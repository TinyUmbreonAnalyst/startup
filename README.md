# Custom Sized TicTacToe
## Elevator pitch
Tic tac toe is an old game, but it never fails to be a fun time for all people involved. But just using the 3x3 grid is very boring and predictable. Introducing a site where you can play tic tac toe in any size, whether it be a 3x3 game, or up to even a 6x6 game! Play with people around the world, or against just the computer. All you have to do is login, select your desired game, state whether you want an online or offline game, and wait for someone else to come and play with you! Regardless of how you do it, it is bound to be fun.
